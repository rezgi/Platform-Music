# Platform-Music
Experiments with procedural music and platform mechanics in Godot

## Experiments

- Music layering and interaction with Godot Mixing Desk
- MIDI parsing, display, logic and editor interface
- Circular levels with working physics and collisions

## Goals

- Procedural music logic ready for game mechanics
- Usable and visible MIDI data structures
- Working circular platform levels and elements
- Overall music logic architecture usable for game mechanics
- Usable interface in editor to create musical mechanics
- Working game mechanics
